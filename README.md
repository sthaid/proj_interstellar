# Interstellar Rocket

This project investigates the feasibility of interstellar spacecraft propelled by reaction mass. This is the same principle that we use today to send spacecraft to other planets in our Solar System.

For more information run 'interstellar -h'.

The results indicate that an enormous amount of energy is required. For example, a spacecraft that has a mass of 1 million kilograms (which is about twice the mass of the International Space Station), traveling a distance of 10 Light Years in 100 years would use about 100,000 times the yearly energy output of the Palo Verdes nuclear power plant. Palo Verdes is the largest generator of electricity in the U.S.

# Where Are the Space Aliens

There are quite a few possible explanations for why we don't have ETs visiting Earth now. Such as:
* There are no ETs.
* The ETs visited Earth a long time ago, finding nothing of interest they left.
* ETs don't like to travel.
* The ETs are here and observing us, but are waiting for the right time to make contact.
* Interstellar travel is impractical.

# Interstellar Travel

Science Fiction writers have explored many possibilities for interstellar travel. Many of the ideas proposed in Science Fiction involve Faster Than Light travel; such as: Hyper Space, Wormholes, Instant Teleportation, and Warp Drive. Unfortunately these ideas will most likely never be possible because the ability to travel from one point to another faster than a photon implies the ability to travel back in time.

Other ideas that are physically possible, but extremely difficult with today's technology:
* Longliner: A large spacecraft that takes hundreds of years to reach a nearby star. Possibly rocket propelled. Passengers could be kept in suspended animation to slow their aging.
* Bussard Ramjet: Large magnetic fields scoop up the interstellar hydrogen, compress and ignite it to provide thrust. This is a very compelling approach, except that their are doubts that this would work, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bussard_ramjet
* Electromagnetic Accelerator (railgun): Propelled by a long linear array of electromagnets. A railgun that is 100 million miles long, with a 10 g acceleration, would propel the spacecraft to a speed of .02 C. A trip of 10 Light Years would take 500 years. Also, a means to stop at the destination is needed.
* Light sail:  Propelled by powerful lasers at a fixed location.
