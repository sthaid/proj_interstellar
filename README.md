Where are the space aliens?
- argument why they should be here
- drake equation

Reasons that they are not here
- they don't exist
- some exist but are too widely scattered in the galaxy
- they used to exist but are now extinct
- they do exist but don't like to travel
- they are here and watching us and waiting for the right time to make contact
- it is not practical to build a spaceship capable of interstellar travel

Interstellar Travel
- FTL: worm hole, warp drive, hyperspace
- Light sail or magnetic sail
- Electromagnetic Accelerator (railgun)
- Bussard Ramjet
- Rocket
